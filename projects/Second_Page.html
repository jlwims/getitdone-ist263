               <li>
                Now lift up your hips so that your body forms an upside down. Your legs and arms should stay as straight as possible.
               </li> 
               <li>
                Bend your elbows and lower your upper body until the top of your head nearly touches the floor.
               </li>
               <li>
                Pause, and then push yourself back up until your arms are straight. 
                Position with straight knees. Begin by bending both elbows and slowly bringing the top of your head to the towel. You should be looking through your legs in the end position not down at the ground.

                <li>
                    Place your toes on top of a flat bench. <br> This will allow your body to be elevated. <br> Note: The higher the elevation of the flat bench, the higher the resistance of the exercise is. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lower yourself until your chest almost touches the floor as you inhale. 
                    Using your pectoral muscles, press your upper body back up to the starting position and squeeze your chest.<br> Breathe out as you perform this step.

                    Doing a shoulder tap the right way requires you to engage several muscles simultaneouslyâ€”your abs, back, chest, and arms.

                <li>
                    Now, with control, while keeping your hips and shoulders level and squared in front of you, lift one palm to the top of your opposite arm and pause for one second before returning to start.

                <li>
                    From there, place one hand on the floor as if in the bottom of a pushup. Place the other hand down and push yourself up until both arms are extended..

                <li>
                    Reverse direction, lowering yourself back into the plank one arm at a time. Keep your core tight so your body doesn't twist to either side. Keep your hips level.

                Preform for recommended amount of reps.

                    Lie on the floor with the knees bent and the feet on the floor around 18-24 inches apart. Your arms should be extended by your side. This will be your starting position.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Crunch over your torso forward and up about 3-4 inches to the right side and touch your right heel as you hold the contraction for a second. Exhale while performing this movement.

                    Now go back slowly to the starting position as you inhale.

                <li>
                    Now crunch over your torso forward and up around 3-4 inches to the left side and touch your left heel as you hold the contraction for a second. Exhale while performing this movement and then go back to the starting position as you inhale. Now that both heels have been touched, that is considered 1 repetition.
                </li>

                    Lie flat on your back with your feet flat on the ground, or resting on a bench with your knees bent at a 90 degree angle. If you are resting your feet on a bench, place them three to four inches apart and point your toes inward so they touch.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place your hands on your thighs while pushing the small of your back down in the floor to better isolate your abdominal muscles, begin to roll your shoulders off the floor allowing your palms to rollover your kneecaps as you crunch up.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Your shoulders should come up off the floor only about four inches, and your lower back should remain on the floor. At the top of the movement, contract your abdominals hard and keep the contraction for a second. Tip: Focus on slow, controlled movement - don't cheat yourself by using momentum.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After the one second contraction, begin to come down slowly again to the starting position as you inhale.

                <li>
                    Step backward with your right leg around two feet or so from the left foot and lower your upper body down, while keeping the torso upright and maintaining balance. Inhale as you go down. Tip: As in the other exercises, do not allow your knee to go forward beyond your toes as you come down, as this will put undue stress on the knee joint. Make sure that you keep your front shin perpendicular to the ground. Keep the torso upright during the lunge; flexible hip flexors are important. A long lunge emphasizes the Gluteus Maximus; a short lunge emphasizes Quadriceps.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Push up and go back to the starting position as you exhale. Tip: Use the ball of your feet to push in order to accentuate the quadriceps. To focus on the glutes, press with your heels.

            <h3>Side to Side Lunge</h3>
            <p style = "margin: 0em .5em;">
                <li>
                    Stand in an athletic position, with the knees and hips slightly bent, feet shoulder-width apart, and the head and chest up. This will be your starting position.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Staying low, take a slow, lateral step to the right. Keep your toes pointed forward and stay low. Extend the left knee, driving your weight to the right, flexing the knee and hip into a side lunge. Maintain good posture through the entire spine, keeping your head and chest up.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pause at the bottom of the motion, and then extend through the working leg to return to a standing position, transitioning into a lunge to the opposite side.
                </li>

            <h3>Low Cossack Lunge</h3>
            <P style = "margin: 0em .5em;">
                <li>
                    Take a wider than shoulder width stance, and turn one foot out to the side with the toe off the floor. Keep that knee straight, and squat to your other leg, trying to keep both heels on the ground and keeping your spine as straight and tall as possible. Lower as deep as comfortable or until you have to start rounding your spine to get any lower.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Return to the start position and repeat for reccommended number of reps.
